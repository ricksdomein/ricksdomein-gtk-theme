## Motivation

This themes provide a fancy neutral dark-balanced color-scheme designed to be __useful__ for a few specific goals.

1. __Minimize eye strain__: when you pass many hours in front of the screen or you are hyper-sensitive to light, saturation and contrast.

2. __Avoid disrupting your circadian rhythms__: a neutral color-cast-free UI helps your body to produce enough melatonin at night time and sleep better, working nicely with software like `redshift`.
